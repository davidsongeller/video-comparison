# Video and GIF Duplicate Analyzer

This Python program allows you to analyze GIFs and videos to identify duplicates with varying content. It combines multiple techniques and libraries to achieve accurate results.

## Features

- Supports analysis of both GIFs and videos.
- Uses OpenCV and FFmpeg for video processing and frame extraction.
- Applies feature extraction algorithms (e.g., SIFT or SURF) to capture distinctive visual features from frames.
- Provides different duplicate detection methods, including feature matching, scene detection, and deep learning-based approaches.
- Assigns similarity scores and thresholds to determine duplicates.
- Performs additional verification steps for accuracy.
